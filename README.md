# Graphics2Repo

GENERAL: Graphics project showing off basic lighting, model and texture loading. Work also done with multiple vertex and pixel shaders, as well as a Geometry shader and multiple rendered viewports.


geometry Shader: Used the geo shader to draw triangles based on each of the verts of the penguin model.

directional Lighting : blue, lights up the back part of the penguin from where the camera is.

point light : red, currently located at the penguins feet next to the pyramid. 

Spotlight : yellow, can be seen more clearly from inside the model when looking down at the penguins feet.
